# Data-Engineering-Worksheets

This is the repository containing the worksheets completed during the data engineering training at the Digital Futures. 
It contains the practice topics of APIs, Web scraping, Regex, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data modeling in Python.

The main content of each assignment is as follows:

##**API practice**:
Requested Disney Characters' data by applying the API of the disney characters and extracted the data of the name, the film, and the URL after observing the data.
Built a dataframe with the extracted data.
